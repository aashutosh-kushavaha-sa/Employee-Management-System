FIX: Corrected environment files to remove self-imports and ensure valid exports.
- frontend/src/environments/environment.ts
- frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts

The environment files MUST export a plain object named `environment`.
After deployment, update production apiUrl in environment.prod.ts.

Now run:
  cd backend/merged-backend
  npm install
  npm start

  cd frontend
  npm install
  ng serve -o
